# DogeClicker-Game
<p>Hello there! This game I have created is a variation of the popular "Clicker style" games found on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The project using Java swing components to implement the GUI. The user is presented with the image of a Shiba Inu dog to click, which generates one dogecoin for them, which they can spend on 
upgrades.</p>
<p> The game currently (25/07/2021) has two upgrades available:</p>
1. Autoclick -> This automatically clicks the doge, which earns you a coin every 10s. It can be bought multiple times
in order to maximise its output, however each purchase drives up the price of the upgrade
<p></p>
2. Double Click -> This feature works by causing each click of the doge to return two coins for a limited amount of time, however each purchase will drive up the price
